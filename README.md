# StoppingDistanceCalculator
My first assignment from Grade 12 Computer Science!  It's a stopping distance calculator that uses the AASHTO formula to calculate the stopping distance of a vehicle on different terrain, elevation, and conditions like that.  I like Physics so I had a lot of fun with this one!
